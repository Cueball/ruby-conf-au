  pitch: |
    Business is slow for Ruby Private Investigator, Deirdre Bug. She‚Äôs on the verge of switching industry when she gets a call from an anxious young man. "Some class methods have gone missing," he tells her breathlessly. "I need your help."

    Deirdre takes the case and begins exploring Ruby objects behind the scenes. Though she thinks she's on familiar ground ‚Äî Ruby's object model, method lookup ‚Äî she's about to discover that she really has no clue.

  title: Cats, The Musical! Algorithmic Song Meow-ification
  pitch: |
    How are you supposed to sing along with your favorite TV theme song every week if it doesn't have lyrics? At my house, we "meow" along (loudly). We also code, so I built 'Meowifier' to convert any song into a cat's meows. Join me in this exploration of melody analysis APIs and gratuitous cat gifs.

    I built an application that takes a song's audio and outputs a new audio file with that song's melody **sung by cats**. It's a technical feat. It's hilarious. It's beautiful. It's a new way to waste time on the internet.
  bio: "[Beth](https://www.bethanyhaubert.com/) is a software engineer who loves Ruby, little-known APIs, handcrafting SQL queries, and as many monitors on her desk as possible. She‚Äôs also a former airborne cryptologic linguist for the US Air Force, fluent in Mandarin. Things you can ask her about include cats, board games, karaoke, and building applications that convert songs into auto-tuned cat meows. Things she'll have to kill you if you ask her about: the airborne linguist part. Also, she likes to make emojis look like they're farting. üêàüí®"

  title: What Could Go Wrong? The Subtle Science Of Coding for Failure
  pitch: |
    Software development is the anticipation of a thousand dangers: regressions, edge-cases, exceptions, attacks, downtime, the list is endless. Drawing from a wide range of disciplines, we‚Äôll build a simple model for quantifying danger, explore why the human brain is so bad at it, and examine some practical applications for our development processes. There will be at least one science.
