  pitch: Becoming a senior contributor to your organization takes years. It's a process that is stubbornly hard to accelerate - it takes much more than drilling code katas! In this talk Xavier reflect on situations he's encountered over the last decade, and apply some academic models he's found useful to explain and learn from them. By doing so we can better understand the limits to learning and prepare ourselves to make the most out of our experience.

  pitch: "Have you ever considered how much pressure your app can handle before it explodes? Do you want to know what’s your app’s bottleneck? I’ll teach how to build a performance testing framework, in RUBY!"
  bio: |
    I learnt Economics and Interpreting and Translation in Uni. But after I graduated I ended up being a dental nurse for 2.5 years. Then I realised I need a career that has bright future so I started to learn software testing. I taught myself the necessary coding skills to became a QA engineer. Later under the mentorship of the other software engineers at Airtasker I became one of them as well. I love Lord of the Rings to death! For me it's the best movie ever! I also love to make fondant cakes and according to my co-workers they are amazing :)

- name: Adel Smee
  title: "Inclusiveness - It's In Your Hands"
  pitch: "The tech industry is a way from creating a safe, nurturing, inclusive culture. This talk will encourage you to get involved in diversity and inclusion work at your company in whatever way makes sense to you. It includes a few pointers to get you started and stories to motivate you along the way."
  bio: |
    Adel Smee is an Engineering Manager at Zendesk where, for the last four years, she has led innovation projects across a variety of technologies and grown a number of high performing teams. Her career in tech started with teaching people to code, before she decided to break out and get paid to do it commercially at a startup, then at Lonely Planet, and then at Zendesk. Along the way she realised that her main implicit motivator is delight in the success of others, which turns out to be a really useful quality in a manager. She is obsessed with what makes people (and herself) tick and loves to hear how she is getting it wrong so she can do better. Adel is an incurable optimist who believes that one day we’ll live in a world where everybody likes their job as much as she does, but isn’t naive enough to think that day is coming any time soon.

- name: Julian Doherty
  title: Escape Your Framework
  pitch: Rails and other frameworks let you quickly throw together ideas to get up and running quickly. But as your app grows, this can limit what you can do. How can we set ourselves up to get the benefits that come from using a framework, while staying flexible and not beholden to it?

- name: Paul Joe George and Do Xuan Thanh
  title: "Build a voice based smart home using Sinatra & mruby/c"
  pitch: "Are you tired of searching for the remote controls? We were in that category and that’s why we decided to replace remote controls and start using a smart assistant like Alexa instead. This talk will share knowledge on how to achieve this by using mruby/c and Sinatra."
  bio: |
    Paul and Thanh are software developers at Monstar Lab Inc.  Living in Matz's hometown, where Ruby is more than a programming language. They use Ruby purely for fun as Ruby is fun. Using Ruby only for traditional Ruby on Rails projects never satisfied them. For that reason they decided to experiment using mruby/c - a mini version of Ruby for one-chip microcontroller programming. Currently they are building more and more practical applications  to inspire other Ruby lovers to start using Ruby for IoT.

  title: "10X your teamwork through pair programming"
  pitch: "A roller coaster journey of how to get the most out of pair-programming. Live on stage acting out highs, lows, do’s and don’ts of pair-programming. Laughs and tears are guaranteed as the audience connect on the difficulties and ultimately the rewards that can be reaped through effective pairing."
  bio: |
    Selena and Michael met through work at Fresho! but soon realised they are the kind of friends who would rather talk tech at a party. So they turned their party times into numerous hackathons, coding camps, and duo talks and workshops on topics around test driving software and pair programming.

  title: "Just my type: things I learned from writing my own programming language"
  pitch: "Do the principles on which a programming language is based shape the community that grows up around it? Heck yes. While writing my own programming language, I was reminded that language creates (not merely carries) meaning. I also learned that you don’t have to be Grace Hopper to write your own."

    Hi, I’m Lena. I’m an avid cat rescuer, learning enthusiast, and Rails Bridge Wellington organising committee member. I started out in design, but fell for web and software development during my first industry internship. I've been writing Ruby since 2015, and I'm currently learning other languages to expand my toolkit. I’m all about finding patterns, building and communicating software in a way that helps everyone understands it, and failing better – mistakes make me a better developer, and I believe that failing is just an opportunity to learn.
    When I’m not coding, I’m watching movies with my 3-legged rescue cat Warlock, collecting enamel pins, and helping out and/or presenting at tech community events around town.

  title: "Walking A Mile In Your Users' Shoes"
  pitch: "Developing apps for users in different demographics is inherently differently than developing apps just for ourselves and for other programmers. Understanding the needs of our users — and learning to foster empathy for them — is just as much of a skill as learning Rails, Java or PHP!"
