  title: "Environment Variables"
  pitch: |
    How can we minimise our software’s contribution to climate change? How do we make software that can withstand climate change-related disasters? How do we deal with the knowledge that we’re careening towards catastrophe?

    I don’t have all the answers, but let’s do some maths about it.

  title: "\"What were they thinking?\""
  pitch: "This is a sentiment many Rails developers have experienced whilst reading a legacy codebase, trying to glean the motivations behind the code or simply understand what it is meant to do. This talk turns that perspective on its head and asks, “what can I do to prevent this scenario?”"
  bio: "Keith Pitty has been developing software professionally for more than three decades. Since 2000 he has maintained a keen interest in Agile approaches and for the last ten years has made many contributions to the Australian Ruby community. He has been fascinated by how developers consider other people when developing software since his early days of programming on mainframes. Away from computers he enjoys golf, is a cricket tragic and a passionate Collingwood supporter."

  title: Hacking Your Emotional API
  pitch: |
    Being a good developer isn’t just about slinging code; we’re part of a community. Interacting with others in a community means feelings are involved.

    In this talk you’ll learn how emotions are affecting you by modeling them as an API and looking at the code.
  bio: John the co-founder and CTO of Data Simply and a Senior Developer at Privia Health. He’s been programming professionally for two decades, in Perl, Java, PHP and Ruby. In recent years he has also been supervising workshops called “Purpose, Passion, Peace” which helps people get deeply in touch with themselves and liberated from past traumas. He has fused his expertise from these disparate areas into a new way of thinking about them both.

  title: Building APIs you want to hug with GraphQL
  pitch: |
    REST-ful, more like stress-ful am I right? What if I told you you could build amazing APIs your cat would be proud of with GraphQL instead.

    Let’s take a look at how to go about implementing a GraphQL API alongside an existing codebase, and how it helps you hide that nasty legacy code away.
  bio: Tom Ridge is a developer currently residing in Brisbane, Australia. A father of twins, he’s recently organised a Rails Camp, was Vice President of Ruby Australia and has co-organised his local meetup. Somehow, he’s still not sure why he has so little free time.

    In one timeline a quick path to clarity. In the other a painful journey trying to uncover the obscure intent of a line of code. The only difference between these two realities? The revision history…

    This is a story about revision histories and their impact on software maintainability. Think Sliding Doors, but with more Git!
