- name: Lauren Tan
  pitch: "At Netflix, we’re continuously reinventing the way we entertain. We’ve sent DVDs in the mail, pioneered streaming video, and now we’re doing it all over again.

- name: Katie McLaughlin
  pitch: "JavaScript. The language developers love to hate. It is full of WATs, whys, and other annoyances; and yet it is the most used programming language in the world. If it’s so powerful, why do developers hate it so? We’ll discuss the power and functionally of this multi-tool of the web."
  bio: "Katie has worn many different hats over the years. She has been a software developer for many languages, systems administrator for multiple operating systems, and speaker on many different topics. When she’s not changing the world, she enjoys making tapestries, cooking, and seeing just how well various application stacks handle emoji."

- name: Andy Nicholson
  pitch: "Did you hear about this great Ruby-like language built in South America? No, not Elixir. Crystal! We’ll take a look at its syntax, design choices, its ecosystem, and tradeoffs. You’ll see how language design affects code, and become a better Rubyist along the way."
  bio: "Human for over 30 years, a developer for 8 years, language polyamorist (but Ruby will always be my first ❤️). I care a lot about the Ruby community, and believe in clear and fun communication. Life's too short for: bad coffee, poor music, and white melamine."

- name: Zach Holman
  pitch: "After you tell developers you’re building a calendar, most will sadly sigh, comfort you, and send you to your doom. Because it’s true: everyone knows dates, times, and timezones can be hugely frustrating concepts in programming. But it turns out what you don’t know is even weirder!"
  bio: "Zach Holman is a developer living in San Francisco. He joined GitHub in 2010 as one of their first engineering hires, and helped build and grow their product and culture over five years. Currently he’s the founder and CEO of During, a new calendar to help you during your day. He also advises startups, including GitLab, StackShare, and Dockbit."

  pitch: "Pilots have the flight deck, Captain Kirk had his bridge, but what do you have for managing failure in your application?"
  bio: "The granddaughter of a former MIT computer (yup, that was a job title), Amy was clearly supposed to be a programmer, but just did not get the message. Her wanderings have taken her through the land of libraries and archives and into software consulting. Now a software engineer at Heroku, she is deeply grateful for every scarce day she does not use vim commands in Google Docs."

  bio: "After many years translating Ancient Greek texts and working with antiquities, Eleanor began tinkering with code — now she writes Ruby instead of reading Homer. When she’s not digging into code at The Conversation, she’s probably cooking, attending a yoga class, or patting other people's dogs at the park."
