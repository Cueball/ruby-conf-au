  title: "The Good Bad Bug: Fail Your Way to Better Code"
  pitch: "Programming is filled with bugs that were actually features. We’ll journey through code that’s so ‘bad’ it’s actually good while discovering the important role failure plays in learning. Then we’ll tame our inner perfectionists & look at an approach to code that will allow us to fail in the best way."
  bio: "Jessica Rudder is a web developer with a passion for clean code and the Kansas City Royals. She once ran 70 miles through the Santa Monica Mountains “just for fun”. When she’s not writing code, she can be found running aimlessly through city streets training for her next ultra or creating code-related videos on YouTube for CompChomp. She is an avid squirrel photographer and loves the color green."

- name: Alaina Kafkes
  title: "Tackling Technical Writing"
  pitch: "Empathetic, accessible, and thorough technical tutorials & blog posts break down Ruby’s barrier to entry and foster inclusion. Thus, Ruby’s fate rests on people who write well – an oft underdeveloped skill. In this talk, I’ll give actionable pointers to get Rubyists started with technical writing."
  bio: "Alaina is a software engineer at Medium, where she works predominantly on iOS development and petting other people’s dogs. She recently graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in computer science and many humanities classes under her belt. Though she’d like to think that her claim to fame is her inability to pronounce the word “corgi,” she’s best known for her technical writing in freeCodeCamp and Chronicles of a Junior Dev, as well as for co-founding BuildHer, Chicago’s first-ever student-run women’s hackathon. Current fascinations include swing dancing and reading fiction."

  pitch: "After you tell developers you’re building a calendar, most will sadly sigh, comfort you, and send you to your doom. Because it’s true: everyone knows dates, times, and timezones can be hugely frustrating concepts in programming. But it turns out what you don’t know is even weirder!"
