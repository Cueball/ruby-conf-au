    %h4 Beth Haubert

    %p.bio <a href="https://www.bethanyhaubert.com">Beth</a> is a software engineer who loves Ruby, little-known APIs, handcrafting SQL queries, and as many monitors on her desk as possible. She‚Äôs also a former airborne cryptologic linguist for the US Air Force, fluent in Mandarin. Things you can ask her about include cats, board games, karaoke, and building applications that convert songs into auto-tuned cat meows. Things she'll have to kill you if you ask her about: the airborne linguist part. Also, she likes to make emojis look like they're farting. üêàüí®

    %h3 Tickets

    %p We will start selling tickets for the upcoming conference on <strong>Monday 10th September</strong> at 11:00AM AEST / 10:30 ACST / 9:00 AWST. There will be a limited number of early bird and concession tickets, and we will also have an Opportunity Program.

    %p Our <strong>Opportunity Program</strong> includes a free ticket to the conference plus an allowance for travel and accommodation costs for those outside Melbourne. This is for people who would otherwise not be able to afford attending RubyConf AU - we know not everyone receives the same opportunities to get ahead in their career, so this is just one step towards evening things out.
