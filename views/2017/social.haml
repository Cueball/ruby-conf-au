      %h3 Opening Party @ ScienceWorks
      %p
        Scienceworks links Melbourne's industry, heritage and applied technology in one place: a new building looking across the arena to the century-old Pumping Station, all under the grand arc of the West Gate Bridge. It is bursting with things to challenge curious minds of all ages.

      %p
        We'll be hosting our Opening Party for RubyConf AU 2017 here, with an evening of access to the interactive exhibits. Indulge your inner child, your inner geek, or just enjoy the company, canapes and a drink or two, and share in the excitement!
