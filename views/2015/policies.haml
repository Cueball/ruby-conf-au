    %h2 Code of Conduct
    %p
      RubyConfAU is organised under the umbrella of
      %a(href="http://www.ruby.org.au/") Ruby Australia
      and follows its Code of Conduct:

    %h2 Matz is nice, and we are nice.

    %p In the same way that Matz has written Ruby with a focus on developer happiness, we are focused on community happiness. The Australian Ruby community is full of wonderful people from a diverse range of backgrounds, and we want to ensure it remains a welcoming and safe environment to all who wish to be a part of it.

    %p Whenever we come together as a community, our shared spaces are opportunities to showcase the best of what we can be. We are there to support our peers - to build each other up, to accept each other for who they are, and to encourage each other to become the people they want to be.

    %p With that in mind, if you are present at RubyConf Australia, whether as an attendee, organiser, sponsor or speaker, we take it as given that you agree to follow this code of conduct:

    %p The Ruby Australia organisation is dedicated to providing harassment-free experiences at events and conferences for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or age. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.

    %p All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any circumstance.

    %p Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members of the community. Be respectful towards others. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate at RubyConf Australia.

    %p Anyone violating these rules at events may be asked to leave the event without a refund at the sole discretion of the organisers.

    %p If you or someone else is subject to harassment, or you have a concern, please contact the event organisers <a href="https://twitter.com/pat">Pat Allan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/melissakaulfuss">Melissa Kaulfuss</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vonconrad">Sebastian von Conrad</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/mattallen">Matt Allen</a>, or member of <a href="http://ruby.org.au/committee-members.html">the Ruby Australia committee</a>. For the duration of the conference, you can also reach the organisers via phone or SMS on <strong>0473 918 291</strong> (and you'll find this number on your conference badge).

    %p The Ruby community is a welcoming and friendly place â€“ thank you for being a part of it.

    %h2 Anti-harassment Policy
    %p
      RubyConf Australia is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.
    %p
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
    %p
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts, and can also be contacted via phone or SMS on <strong>0473 918 291</strong> (and you'll find this number on your conference badge).
    %p
      Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

      We expect participants to follow these rules at the conference venue and conference-related social events.
