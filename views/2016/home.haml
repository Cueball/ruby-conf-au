        %p
          Sometimes everything just clicks, solutions just come to you and as you quietly tap away you feel almost at one with the computer, you're in the zone. At other times, nothing seems to make sense. You've been struggling with this one issue for hours and not even StackOverflow seems to know what the problem is and you feel like your brain is about to explode. Why do I even do this?! You're in the chasm.
        %p
          Join Richie & Dan as we explore what is "Developer Flow" and how it affect your productivity as a programmer. This workshop is designed for the post-beginner/intermediate developer who maybe has a few coding books, favorite gems and editor shortcuts under their belt but is still hunting for a more peaceful and focussed way to code.
        %p
          In an interactive full day workshop we'll discuss, pair, debate and compare and dig deep to help you find your own path to greater developer flow and finding your way more often into the zone. Richie Khoo is a serial polyglot and extreme learner. Richie has been working as a ruby gun-for-hire for over 6 years and is planning a trip to the ruby mother country Japan in 2016. Dan Draper is much awesome.

          %a{ href: "https://ti.to/ruby-australia/rubyconf-workshops-2016", target: "_blank" } Tasteful Go
        %p
          Go is a beautiful, minimalistic, and consistent language. It is simple, yet learning it can feel quite intimidating for many developers who come to the language without a background in Computer Science.

        %p
          Join Katrina Owen for this hands-on, one-day workshop, focused on developing fluency and ease with the fundamental features of the language. It provides a practical introduction to writing Go the way Gophers expect to see it written.

        %p
          Participants switch between writing code to solve small exercises, and reviewing pre-selected solutions that exemplify common gotchas and style violations. We look at the official recommendations relevant to each example.
          Finally we look at several idiomatic solutions that make good use of the language features.

        %p
          By the end of the day, participants should be comfortable reading Go code, and able to solve basic problems idiomatically.

        %p
          The ideal participant is currently programming professionally in a language other than Go.

        %p
          Trailblazer is an extension framework on top of Rails. It provides desperately needed, new abstraction layers, decent encapsulation and a better maintainable architecture.
        %p
          In this workshop we're gonna learn the basics about designing your domain, encapsulating business logic in operations, form objects and view models, and a different take on the persistence layer. After a compact introducing presentation by Nick Kirkwood and Nick Sutterer, we'll dive into the code, write a small Trailblazer/Rails app and learn all the nice things about this alternative architecture over a cold bottle of beer.

        %p
          Learn sketching, prototyping, basic programming and get introduced to the world of technology. Rails Girls was born in Finland, but is nowadays a global, non-profit volunteer community.
