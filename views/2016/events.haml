        .event__date-time
          10am - 2pm, Saturday, 16 Feb
      %p
        Stand Up Paddle boarding (SUP) on the Gold Coast is very quickly becoming one of the most popular daytime pastimes
        for many reasons. It activates muscles throughout the whole body (but in a very low impact way) and is great for core
        fitness, all whilst virtually silently cruising the picturesque waterways of Australia’s favourite holiday
        destination. Being relatively easy to learn, SUP is an excellent activity for the whole family, some
        people even have their dogs on the boards with them! The fun, laughter and smiles make for a great day out on
        the water.
      %p
        There will be an additional cost for the tickets, estimated at $45.
